## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.1 Roadmap]: Token foundation (Phase 8) must complete before all other visual work -- design tokens are prerequisites
- [v1.1 Roadmap]: Phases 9-11 are independent after Phase 8 -- can reorder if needed
- [v1.1 Roadmap]: Only 2 new dependencies (Space Grotesk + Space Mono fonts) -- everything else uses existing stack

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Backdrop-blur on mobile can cause audio stuttering -- limit to one element (player bar)
- [Research]: CSS transforms on waveform ancestors break drag-to-seek -- never apply transform/filter to waveform parent elements
- [Research]: Current app already fails WCAG AA contrast (text-zinc-500 on zinc-950 = 4.12:1) -- Phase 8 must fix this
