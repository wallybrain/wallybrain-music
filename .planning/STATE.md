## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure derived from 27 requirements; persistent player deferred to Phase 7 due to SPA complexity
- [Roadmap]: Processing pipeline (Phase 2) before playback (Phase 3) -- cannot play what hasn't been processed
- [Research]: SvelteKit + SQLite + wavesurfer.js + ffmpeg + audiowaveform stack confirmed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: audiowaveform installation in Docker needs evaluation during Phase 2 planning (build from source vs pre-built binary)
- [Research]: Persistent player (Phase 7) may need architectural prep in Phase 1 SvelteKit config -- evaluate during Phase 1 planning
