# Requirements: wallybrain-music

**Defined:** 2026-02-09
**Core Value:** Visitors can discover and listen to wallybrain's music through an immersive, visually engaging waveform player

## v1.1 Requirements

Requirements for visual polish milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Design Foundation

- [ ] **DSGN-01**: Site uses custom typography -- Space Grotesk for headings, Space Mono for timestamps, system fonts for body
- [ ] **DSGN-02**: Color palette uses OKLCH design tokens defined via Tailwind v4 @theme with semantic names (surface, accent, text-primary)
- [ ] **DSGN-03**: All text meets WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum against background)
- [ ] **DSGN-04**: Typography hierarchy is visually distinct -- headings, body, captions, and metadata have clear size/weight/tracking differentiation

### Visual Richness

- [ ] **ATMO-01**: Waveform uses gradient colors (purple-to-violet progression) instead of flat single colors
- [ ] **ATMO-02**: Cover art has depth -- shadow, subtle border, or glow effect that lifts it off the background
- [ ] **ATMO-03**: Track cards have hover micro-interactions (scale, shadow lift, or background shift)
- [ ] **ATMO-04**: Persistent player bar uses glassmorphism effect (translucent background with blur)
- [ ] **ATMO-05**: Page background has subtle gradient or texture, not flat zinc-950
- [ ] **ATMO-06**: Loading states use skeleton placeholders instead of blank space

### Signature Identity

- [ ] **SIGN-01**: Track detail page extracts dominant color from cover art and uses it as an ambient accent (tinted background, glow)
- [ ] **SIGN-02**: Currently-playing track shows an equalizer bar animation indicator
- [ ] **SIGN-03**: Track listing uses staggered entrance animations when tracks load
- [ ] **SIGN-04**: Cover art on track detail page has an ambient glow matching the dominant color

### Refinement

- [ ] **REFI-01**: Track listing supports grid/list layout toggle
- [ ] **REFI-02**: Page navigation uses smooth transitions (View Transitions API or Svelte transitions)
- [ ] **REFI-03**: Cover art has hover zoom effect on track cards

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Social Interaction (from v2 backlog)

- **SOCL-01**: Visitor can create an account to interact with tracks
- **SOCL-02**: Registered user can leave comments on tracks
- **SOCL-03**: Registered user can like/favorite tracks
- **SOCL-04**: Timed comments on waveform (SoundCloud-style)

### Content Delivery

- **CDN-01**: Audio files served via CDN for global performance
- **DL-01**: Visitor can download tracks (gated behind email or account)

### Curation

- **CUR-01**: Admin can create curated playlists/collections
- **CUR-02**: Invite-only interaction mode for selected users

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Light mode / theme switcher | Dark theme is core to electronic music identity |
| Real-time audio visualizer (canvas-based) | High complexity, performance cost, not core to polish |
| Particle backgrounds | Performance cost, gimmicky, distracting from music |
| Custom cursor | Accessibility concerns, platform inconsistency |
| User accounts / authentication | v1 is display-only; deferred to v2 |
| New features beyond visual polish | v1.1 is visual only + minor UX fixes |
